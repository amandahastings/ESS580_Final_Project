## Introduction


This project served as an introduction to spatial analysis in R and consisted of two parts. In part I, we utilized data from the LAGOS program to investigate the spatial distribution and size of lakes in three midwestern US states: Illinois, Iowa, and Minnesota. 

Project objectives: 

a) Use mapview package to create interactive maps 

b) Utilize sf package to work with geospatial vector data

c) Assess the distribution of lake size across states 


## Methods 


### Data Acquisition


```{r data-read}
#Download LAGOS data
# LAGOSNE::lagosne_get(dest_folder = LAGOSNE:::lagos_path())

#Load in LAGOS data
lagos <- lagosne_load()

#Parse out lake centroid information
lake_centers <- lagos$locus
# load('lake_centers.Rdata')
```


### Data Processing


```{r include=F}
#Look at the column names
#names(lake_centers)

#Look at the structure
#str(lake_centers)

#View the full dataset
#View(lake_centers %>% slice(1:100))
```


```{r}
#Create spatial object for lakes 
spatial_lakes <- st_as_sf(lake_centers,coords=c('nhd_long','nhd_lat'),
                          crs=4326) %>%
  st_transform(2163)

#Subset number of lakes for plotting
subset_spatial <- spatial_lakes %>%
  slice(1:100) 

subset_baser <- spatial_lakes[1:100,]

#Dynamic mapviewer
mapview(subset_spatial)
```


```{r}
#Create states variable 
states <- us_states()

#Select only Minnesota from states data 
minnesota <- states %>%
  filter(name == 'Minnesota') %>%
  st_transform(2163)

#Subset lakes based on spatial position
minnesota_lakes <- spatial_lakes[minnesota,]
```


```{r, include=F}
#Plot all the states to check if they loaded
#mapview(states)
```


## Results


```{r}
#Plot the first 1000 Minnesota lakes
#Color by lake area in hectares
minnesota_lakes %>%
  arrange(-lake_area_ha) %>%
  slice(1:1000) %>%
  mapview(.,zcol = 'lake_area_ha', at=c(0,500,1500,3000,7500,15000,30000,65000,125000),layer.name='Lake area (ha)')+ mapview(minnesota,layer.name="Minnesota", alpha.regions=0.35, col.regions="#fcf87f")
```

In our analysis of the spatial distribution and size of lakes in Minnesota, Iowa, and Illinois, we found Minnesota exceeded the other two states both in the number of sites included in the LAGOS dataset and the size of lakes recorded in each state. There are 16446 sites in the LAGOS dataset for Illinois and Iowa combined. Meanwhile, there are 29038 Minnesota sites, exceeding the number of sites in Illinois/Iowa by 12572 sites. Furthermore, Minnesota lake size was generally greater than Iowa and Illinois lake size. Though, the distributions of lake size for all states are positively skewed. 


### Additional data sources {-}


Additional useful sources for assessing reservoir and lake size:


*The Global Lake area, Climate, and Population (GLCP) dataset is comprised of lake surface area data (from the datasets listed below), as well as temperature, precipitation, and population data (Meyer et al. 2020).

*The HydroLAKES dataset combines information from multiple lake datasets, including NASA SRTM, Water Body Data, and the Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (Meyer et al. 2020). This dataset consists of shapefiles with attributes such as lake surface area, total volume, average depth, geographic coordinates of pour points, and more (Meyer et al. 2020). 

*The Global Surface Water Dataset, derived from LANDSAT imagery and hosted by the Joint Research Centre (JRC), provides information regarding surface water area for lakes, as well as rivers, streams, and wetlands (Meyer et al. 2020). A subset of this data based upon yearly water classification history is available via Google Earth Engine (Meyer et al. 2020). 

*Also, the [Central Midwest Water Science Center](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/cm-water/science/real-time-data-links?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects) is another resource, for Iowa and Illinois lake data specifically.
