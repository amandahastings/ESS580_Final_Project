## Introduction


This project served as an introduction to workflow tools: R Markdown, Git, and GitHub. To complete project objectives, we utilized US Geological Survey (USGS) discharge data for the Cache la Poudre River at the Lincoln Avenue bridge in Fort Collins, CO. 

Project objectives included: 

a) Fork example repository to personal GitHub 

b) Explore R Markdown formatting 

c) Utilize dygraphs package for interactive plotting

d) Commit and push work to GitHub


## Methods 


### Site Description {-}


The Poudre River at Lincoln Bridge is:

  - Near Old Town Fort Collins, CO and multiple craft breweries, including Odell Brewing 
  
  - Near an open space and the Poudre River Trail

  - Downstream of only some urban stormwater
  
  - **Downstream of many agricultural diversions**

### Data Acquistion {-}


We retrieved discharge data using the dataRetrieval R package from the USGS NWIS web service. 


```{r downloader}
#Download Poudre River discharge data at Lincoln Bridge site from NWIS web service
DischargeData <- readNWISdv(
  siteNumbers = '06752260',
  parameterCd = '00060',
  startDate = '2017-01-01',
  endDate = '2022-01-01') %>%
  rename(discharge = 'X_00060_00003')
```


## Results 


### Static Plotting {-}


```{r static plot, warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
#Create statis plot of Poudre discharge data with ggplot
ggplot(DischargeData, aes(x = Date, y = discharge)) + 
  geom_line(color="#0c7f83") + 
  theme_few()+
  ylab('Discharge (cfs)') + 
  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12)) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(
    color = "black",
    size = 9,
    vjust = .8,
    hjust = .8
  )) +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank()) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(
    color = "black",
    size = 10,
    vjust = .8,
    hjust = .8
  )) +
  ggtitle('Discharge in the Poudre River, Fort Collins, CO')
```

### Interactive Plotting {-}


```{r interactive plot, echo=FALSE}
#Create time series object for discharge data
discharge_xts <- xts(DischargeData$discharge, order.by = DischargeData$Date)

#Create interactive plot with dygraphs 
dygraph(discharge_xts) %>%
  dyOptions(strokeWidth = 0.7, drawPoints = TRUE, pointSize = 1.25, fillGraph=TRUE,fillAlpha=0.25) %>%
  dyAxis("y",label = "") %>%
  dyAxis("x", axisLabelFontSize = 12) %>%
  dySeries("V1", label = "Discharge (cfs)")%>% 
  dyLegend(show="always")
```

Meandering through Roosevelt National Forest and dropping approximately 7,000 feet in elevation, the Cache la Poudre River stretches from peaks along the Continental Divide to foothills of the Front Range near Fort Collins, CO (USFS). Despite the great length of the river, stretches of uninterrupted habitat for resident fishes are becoming increasingly limited— particularly with the construction of man-made diversion structures (Bloom, 2018). As of 2018, researchers estimated approximately **82%** Great Plains fish are in decline, with species such as the common shiner, [*Luxilus cornutus*]( https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/factsheet.aspx?SpeciesID=563), and the central stoneroller, [*Campostoma anomalum*](https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/factsheet.aspx?SpeciesID=506), potentially lost to northern Colorado waterways (Bloom, 2018). Species including small minnows— such as the red shiner, *Cyprinella lutrensis*, and orangespotted sunfish, *Lepomis humilis*– require stretches of **at least** 30 miles to migrate and spawn (Bloom, 2018). However, could another man-made structure potentially offset the necessary, yet imperiling, structures in place? 

CSU researcher Dr. Chris Myrick and his graduate students built a fish ladder for small fishes, similar to those previously built for larger fishes, to essentially extend their, otherwise interrupted, habitat. [Here]( https://youtu.be/7x7O9r5j5fE) is a fish eye’s view of the fish ladder the team created. While the only fish ladder within Larimer County, the research team hopes the design will be transferable and a means to protect small fish across other states as well (Bloom, 2018). 


Another noteworthy fact about the Poudre river: it is the **only** designated National Wild and Scenic River within the state of Colorado (USFS).
